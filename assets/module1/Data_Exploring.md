# Data Exploring
First of all, we must understand the nature of the data set, we need to know things like, how many data are avaliable in the dataset, what kind of variables we are dealing with, we must know if they are numbers, words or any other kind of information.

### Disclaimer
As mentioned before, we are going to use python programming + AI tools, most specifically in google colab due to the flexibility and easygoing use, this is just to mention the tools we're going to use for this study, but it's not necessary to deeply know about it cause this is a general study wich only contains procedure and results, **no coding included**.

Lets load the data set and see how many information we have
