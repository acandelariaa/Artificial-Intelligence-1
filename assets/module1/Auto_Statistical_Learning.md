# Auto-Statistical Learning
Due to the potential of AI use in data proccesing, in this module we're going to explore the basic concepts of statistical analysis using python programming.
For this particular case, we will be using a dataset of obesity data which contains variables such as, water consume, height, weight, age, and others.

Dataset
[Obesity Dataset](./assets/module1/resources/A1_1_Obesidad.csv)

All of this with the objective of understanding the nature of the dataset, reach statistical inferences (understanding the behavior of the dataset), and explore opportunity areas.
